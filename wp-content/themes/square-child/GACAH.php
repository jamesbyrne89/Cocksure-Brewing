<p>At Cocksure Brewing Co. we're not just making great tasting beer.  We're also doing our bit to help others.</p>

<p></p>We joined forces with leading international development charity, Farm Africa, and are donating 25 pence from every case of Cocksure sold to support their sustainable farming projects in Africa.</p>

Farm Africa’s poultry projects in eastern Africa empower local farmers to build environmentally friendly and sustainable businesses which lift their families out of poverty.
